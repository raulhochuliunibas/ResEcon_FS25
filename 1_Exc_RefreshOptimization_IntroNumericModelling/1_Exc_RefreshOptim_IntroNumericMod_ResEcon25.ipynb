    "Before starting with  numerical optimizations, we first need to get a understanding of how to handle functions in software. As we (should) know, 2D-functions are ”well-behaved” if they are uniquely defined over both x and y-axis. In short, a function f(x) assigns each continuous x-value a unique corresponding y-value. Simply put, this means the function has no kinks, steps or breaks. Now Python is not specifically built to calculate or visualize functions. WolframAlpha or GeoGebra for example are much more usefull tools fort that (which can also derive equation for example). \n",
